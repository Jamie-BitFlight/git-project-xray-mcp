# Getting Started with XRAY

XRAY is a powerful code intelligence system that enhances AI assistants' understanding of codebases. It provides fast symbol search, impact analysis, dependency tracking, and location-based queries.

## Supported Languages

XRAY currently supports:
- **Python** - Functions, classes, methods, imports, function calls
- **JavaScript** - Functions, classes, methods, imports, exports, arrow functions
- **TypeScript** - All JavaScript features plus interfaces, type aliases, enums, namespaces
- **Go** - Functions, structs, interfaces, methods, imports, type declarations

## üöÄ Quick Start (30 seconds)

> **Recommended:** For the modern installation experience using `uv` (10-100x faster than pip), see [GETTING_STARTED_UV.md](GETTING_STARTED_UV.md)

### Option 1: Quick Start with `install.sh` (Recommended)

For the fastest and easiest setup, use our automated installation script. This script handles cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and creating a convenient wrapper script to run the XRAY MCP server.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srijanshukla18/xray/main/install.sh | bash
```

After running the script, you can start the XRAY MCP server by simply typing `xray-mcp` in your terminal.

### Option 2: Manual Python Installation

This method installs XRAY directly into your Python environment and provides direct access to your local filesystem for analyzing codebases. Use this option if you prefer more control over the installation process.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.11+
*   Git

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/srijanshukla18/xray.git
cd xray

# Install dependencies (using a virtual environment is recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -e .

# Run server
python run_server.py
```

## üîå MCP Client Integration

After installing XRAY, you need to configure your AI assistant (MCP Client) to communicate with the XRAY server. You will typically add a JSON configuration snippet to your client's settings.

You can use the `mcp-config-generator.py` script to help create the correct configuration for your setup:

```bash
# Example: Generate config for Cursor using local Python installation
python mcp-config-generator.py cursor local_python
```

Here are example configuration snippets for common clients:

### Cursor

Go to: `Settings` ‚Üí `Cursor Settings` ‚Üí `MCP` ‚Üí `Add new global MCP server`

*   **Local Python Installation:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "xray": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["-m", "xray.mcp_server"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Installed Script (Recommended):**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "xray": {
          "command": "xray-mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS).

*   **Local Python Installation:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "xray": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["-m", "xray.mcp_server"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Installed Script (Recommended):**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "xray": {
          "command": "xray-mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### VS Code

Add to your VS Code MCP config file.

*   **Local Python Installation:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "servers": {
          "xray": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["-m", "xray.mcp_server"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Installed Script (Recommended):**
    ```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "servers": {
          "xray": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "xray-mcp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## üéØ Specifying Target Repository

XRAY tools accept a `path` parameter to specify which repository to analyze. By default, they analyze the current working directory.

```bash
# Examples when using XRAY tools:
build_index(path="/path/to/your/project")
find_symbol(query="UserService", path="/path/to/your/project")
what_breaks(symbol_name="authenticate", path="/path/to/your/project")
```

If you don't specify a path, XRAY will analyze the current directory. When XRAY detects it's analyzing its own codebase, it will show a warning.

## üìÅ Database Storage

XRAY stores its databases in your home directory at `~/.xray/databases/`. Each repository gets its own database based on a hash of its path, allowing multiple repositories to be analyzed simultaneously without conflicts.

## üéØ Usage

Once installed and configured, use XRAY's code intelligence tools by adding `use XRAY tools` to your prompts within your AI assistant.

**Example Prompts:**

*   `Analyze the UserService class and show me what would break if I change the authenticate method. use XRAY tools`
*   `Find all functions that call validate_user and show their dependencies. use XRAY tools`
*   `What symbol is defined at line 42 in auth.py? use XRAY tools`

### Available Tools

*   **`build_index`**: Index your codebase for analysis.
*   **`find_symbol`**: Search for functions/classes by name.
*   **`what_breaks`**: Impact analysis (shows what depends on a symbol).
*   **`what_depends`**: Dependency analysis (shows what a symbol uses).
*   **`get_info`**: Get the symbol at a specific file and line number.

## üß™ Verify Your Installation

After installation, you can verify XRAY is working correctly:

### Quick Test

```bash
# Run the installation test script
python test_installation.py
```

This will check:
- All required modules are installed
- Language parsers are available  
- Basic indexing functionality works
- MCP server can be initialized

### Manual Test

1. Create a test file `example.py`:
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(items)

class ShoppingCart:
    def add_item(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
```

2. In your AI assistant, test these commands:
   - `Build the index for the current directory. use XRAY tools`
   - `Find all functions in example.py. use XRAY tools`
   - `What would break if I change add_item? use XRAY tools`

## üÜò Troubleshooting

*   **Python not found:** Make sure Python 3.11+ is installed and correctly added to your system's PATH.
*   **Docker not running:** This option has been removed. Please use the Python installation method.
*   **Permission denied:** You might need to run commands with `sudo` or check file/directory permissions.
*   **Port conflicts:** XRAY uses standard input/output (stdio) by default, so port conflicts are generally not an issue unless you explicitly configure it to use a network port.
*   **Import errors:** Run `python test_installation.py` to diagnose missing dependencies.
